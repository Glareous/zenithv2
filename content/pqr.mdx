### ⚡ AI-Powered PQR Prioritization System  
#### System Design & Technical Documentation

<br />

The AI-Powered PQR Prioritization System analyzes, classifies, and prioritizes each incoming PQR using a fine-tuned in-house AI model optimized for operational, legal, and fraud-risk detection.

This ensures critical cases receive immediate attention while providing full transparency and fair decision-making.

<br />



### 🧩 System Architecture

<br />

<Callout type="info">
The platform was engineered to be fast, modular, scalable, and enterprise-grade.
</Callout>

<br />

The architecture consists of four layers:

- **Frontend (React + Next.js)** — User interface for creating and reviewing PQRs  
- **Backend (Python)** — Business logic, AI orchestration, and SLA rules  
- **AI Engine** — Local model running on NVIDIA L40S GPU  
- **Database (MongoDB)** — Persistent storage and historical analytics  

<br />



### 🖥️ Frontend (React + Next.js)

<br />

- Modern and responsive UI  
- Secure data entry  
- Real-time display of AI classification results  

<br />



### ⚙️ Backend (Python)

<br />

- Microservice architecture  
- Routes for classification, audit, SLA, scoring, and override logic  
- Fast async GPU inference routing  

<br />



### 🧠 AI Engine (NVIDIA L40S)

<br />

- Proprietary **gtt-oos-20B** language model  
- Trained specifically for PQR patterns, legal risk, financial disputes, and emotional classification  
- Performs topic detection, sentiment, emotion analysis, legal/threat detection, and fraud prediction  

<br />

<Callout type="warning">
All inference runs **locally on GPU hardware**, ensuring full data privacy, ultra-low latency, and regulatory compliance.
</Callout>

<br />



### 🗄️ Database (MongoDB)

<br />

Stores:

- Raw PQR data  
- AI outputs  
- Risk score  
- Final priority  
- SLA deadline  
- Overrides  
- Historical audit logs  

<br />



### 📝 Input Fields (Web PQR Form)

<br />

These fields form the structure of the PQR entry:

#### First Name
The customer's given name. Used to personalize communication and support identification.

#### Last Name
Customer's family name. Used with first name for full identification.

#### Phone
Primary contact number. Useful for urgent follow-up in high-risk cases.

#### Email
Customer's email address. Used for notifications and formal responses.

#### City
Location of the customer. Helps identify regional risk patterns or regulatory considerations.

#### Document Type
Type of identification (CC, CE, Passport). Determines how the entity validates user identity.

#### Document Number
The ID number associated with the selected document type. Helps uniquely identify the customer in the organization's systems.

#### Status
Represents the lifecycle state of the PQR. Default is *Processing* until resolved.

#### Message
The **core text** entered by the customer.  
This is the primary input for the AI, and includes the user's request, complaint, or claim.

<br />

<Callout type="success">
The <strong>Message</strong> field drives 80% of the AI logic: topic classification, emotion detection, urgency evaluation, and risk scoring depend on its content.
</Callout>

<br />



### 🧪 AI Processing Pipeline

<br />

The AI engine performs multilayer analysis:

#### 1. Text Processing  
- Cleans and structures input  
- Extracts relevant entities (amounts, deadlines, threats, legal words)  

<br />

#### 2. Sentiment & Emotion Detection  
- Sentiment: positive, neutral, negative  
- Emotions: anger, frustration, fear, anxiety, urgency  

<br />

#### 3. Topic Classification (Taxonomy)

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **L0 – Critical** | Fraud, identity theft, legal action | hacked, stolen, lawsuit |
| **L1 – High** | High-risk financial/legal terms | fraud, estafa, demanda |
| **L2 – Medium** | Complaints & recurring issues | reclamo, cobro |
| **L3 – Low** | Administrative requests | paz y salvo, certificate |
| **L4 – Info** | Queries, gratitude | thanks, inquiry |

<br />

#### 4. Risk Score (0–100)

Weighted criteria:

- Topic / Intent — 40 pts  
- Sentiment — 15 pts  
- Emotion — 15 pts  
- Urgency / Threat — 10 pts  
- VIP Status — 10 pts  
- Historical / Amount — 5–10 pts  

<br />

#### 5. SLA Assignment

| Score | Level | SLA |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ≥ 85 | **L0 – Critical** | ≤ 30 minutes |
| 65–84 | **L1 – High** | ≤ 2 hours |
| 45–64 | **L2 – Medium** | ≤ 24 hours |
| 25–44 | **L3 – Low** | ≤ 72 hours |
| 0–24 | **L4 – Info** | Self-service |

<br />

#### 6. Override Rules

- VIP → minimum **L1**  
- Fraud → always **L0**  
- Press/media → escalate one level  
- Legal threats → escalate automatically  

<br />

<Callout type="warning">
Overrides protect customers, ensure fairness, and safeguard institutional reputation.
